"""01_welcome_message_and_name.
This is the first part of the Maori Number Quiz.
It is what the user will see first as soon as they run the program.
As this is the only version, I will use this in my base code."""


# Welcome Message
print("---Welcome to the Maori Number Quiz---")
print()
# Asks for name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print()
# Combines welcome message and name
print(f"Welcome to the Maori Number Quiz, {name}!")
